    <h2>How to Make Lasagna</h2>
    <p>Making lasagna can be time-consuming, but the results are well worth the wait. </p>
    <p>You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Meat: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage(1 pound) and lean ground beef(¾ pound).</li>
        <li>Onion and garlic: An onion(½ cup) and two cloves of garlic(2x) are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
        <li>Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes(1x(28 ounce)), two cans of tomato sauce(2x(6.5 ounce)), and two cans of tomato paste(2x(6 ounce)).</li>
        <li>Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar(2x) add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
        <li>Water: Half cup of water for the sauce</li>
        <li>Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley(4 tablespoons), dried basil leaves(1 ½ teaspoons), salt(1 ½ teaspoons), Italian seasoning(1 teaspoon), fennel seeds(½ teaspoon), and black pepper(¼ teaspoon).</li>
        <li>Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles(12x).
        </li>
        <li>Cheeses: Parmesan(¾ cup), mozzarella(¾ pound), and ricotta cheese(16 ounces) make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
        <li>Egg: An egg(1x) helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol><br>
